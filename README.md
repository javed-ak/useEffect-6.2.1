## Hook (useEffect)

In this Repo, I'll write a code use of Hook (useEffect)

useEffect is basically a Hook which is use to use a function in any condition.

Form daily life example: If you have a bike and its milage is 46km and you have a petrol tank of 2l, and you have to go 150km. Then you fill full tank before start journey. After 1km you see a filling station and you didn't refill the tank full, but after 500m you saw another filling station but now you refill the tank and go further. In the same way "useEffect" work. When the requirement of the function then it run otherwise the function didn't run again and again.
